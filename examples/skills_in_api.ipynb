    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Skills are the missing “middle layer” between prompts and tools: **prompts** define always-on behavior, **tools** provide atomic capabilities and side effects, and **skills** package repeatable procedures (instructions + scripts + assets) that the model can **mount and execute only when needed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A key takeaway from this cookbook: **use skills to keep your system prompts lean and your workflows durable.** Start small—bundle one stable procedure with a clear `SKILL.md`, make it runnable as a tiny CLI, and ship it. Once it’s in production, pin versions for reproducibility, iterate safely by publishing new versions, and treat your skills library like an internal standard library: audited, discoverable, and shared across agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "As users scale from single-turn assistants to long-running agents, Skills help turn “prompt spaghetti” into **maintainable, testable, versioned workflows**—the kind of building block you can trust, reuse, and evolve over time."
